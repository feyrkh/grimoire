= Chemistry
== Phases of precept matter
* Solid - Melted to liquid, used as catalyst in liquid or gas, transmuted by light
* Liquid - Frozen to solid, heated to gas, temper's pure light into alchemical light
* Gas - Condensed to liquid, temper's pure light into alchemical light
* Light -

== Tools
* Glass containers + pipes
* Sealed jars - contain liquids, solids and gases
* Heat/cold source
* Light source - Produces a beam of pure light
* Lens - Hollow lens, if filled with liquid or gas precept it will transmute pure light that flows through it.
* Prism - Splits alchemical light into its component precepts
* Centrifuge - Separates a combined liquid/gas into layers based on mass
* Pressurizer - For high-pressure infusing or condensing, can increase or decrease pressure
* Mixer - Thoroughly mix substances which might otherwise tend to settle
* Filter - Captures particles of precept matter > than a specified mass and pushes them into a side flask.

== Precept matter stats
* Melting/freezing point: Temp at which (under 1 atmosphere of pressure) a solid/liquid transitions to liquid/solid.
* Boiling/condensation point: Temp at which (under 1 atmosphere of pressure) a liquid/gas transitions to gas/liquid.
* Splitting point: Temp at which (under 1 atmosphere) a gas splits into its component precepts.
* Pressure sensitivity: Change in melting/freezing/evaporation/condensation points as pressure goes up/down.
Pressure sensitivity is in degrees per centiatmosphere.
* Mass: Weight of the substance. Mainly determines centrifuge order. For non-basic precepts, weight = sum(component weights)
* Energy: Amount of energy in this substance. When splitting precepts, heat is released if the sum(component energy) is less
than this precept's energy - 1 degree per energy difference per volume split. If sum(component energy) is greater than this
precept's energy, the temperature of the resulting products are reduced by the the same amount. When combining, temp
increases if the product's energy is less than the component sum, or decreases if it's greater.
* Temperature: Current temperature of the substance. Temperature equalizes between adjacent drops of liquid over time.
