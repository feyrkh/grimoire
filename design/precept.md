# Precept
## Constructing Precepts
Precepts are descriptions of laws or elements of nature. The most basic precepts are called 'axioms'. Two axioms may
be combined to create a 1st-order precept. A 1st order precept and an axiom or another 1st order precept may be combined
to create a 2nd order precept. A 2nd order precept and an axiom, a 1st order or another 2nd order precept may be combined
to create a 3rd order precept, and so on. Precepts are constructed through [research](research.md).
