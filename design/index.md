## Game Design
### Game Setup
1. Generate random [theorem map](theorem_map.md)
0. Set up initial [courses](course.md)
0. Run through a couple years of undergrad processing until you get some potential graduates

### Game Loop
1. Receive Potential Grad Student Dossiers
0. Interview Selected Potential Grad Students
0. Accept Selected Grad Students 
0. Review Grad Student Stats
0. Create Customized Courses & Degree Programs
    * Fundamentals - [precepts](precept.md) and [arguments](argument.md)
    * Learning [Theorems](theorem.md)
    * Practical [Labs](lab.md)
        * [Tattoos](tattoo.md) on students
        * Building [structures](structure.md)
        * [Crafting](crafting.md)
        * Studying [grimoires](grimoires.md)
    
0. Assign Courses to Grad Students
0. Assign Staff Research [(research)](research.md)
0. Get Research Results
    1. View newly discovered precepts
    2. View newly discovered theorems
    3. Assign research points to theorems
    4. Assign research points to grimoires
    5. Assign research points to improve courses
0. Get Undergrad Results
    * Number of total undergrads at start of season
    * Number flunked out
    * Number new admissions
    * Number graduated
    * Number total undergrads at end of season
0. Get Grad Student Results
    * Grad students present [dissertation](dissertation.md)
0. Read about [situations](situation.md) to be investigated/resolved
    1. Choose a situation to investigate
    0. Choose 1+ grad students or faculty to investigate
0. Get [situation](situation.md) results
